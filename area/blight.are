to the west is perhaps the most disturbing of all.  You are standing on the

a huge mirror of pollished obsidian.  It's calm and lack of life chill you to
the bone, surely one step into those evil waters would mean your death.

seem to get thier attention.  More importantly, as you look at some of the

You have reached the beginning of Tarwin's Gap.  The largest pass in the
Mountains of Dhoom.  Many great battles have taken place in this gap.
Traditionally the Malkerians defended this gap.  Once that that kingdom fell
the duty fell to the borderland kingdom of Shienar.  You see more than a fist
of Trollocs camped in the gap.  Going further to the north would be suicide.
With the Dragonwall to the east, and the Mountains of Dhoom to the north, you

where they made thier last stand against the Trolloc invaders.  The skeletons
of humans and Trollocs alike litter the floor.  You notice with respect that
the Malkeri must have killed three Trollocs for every man that died after a

To the north lay the Mountains of Dhoom, that few men have travelled north of,
and even less have returned.  But, what lies to the west is perhaps the most
disturbing of all.  You are standing on the shore of the Dead Sea.  It's black
and lifeless waters are perfectly still like a huge mirror of pollished
obsidian.  It's calm and lack of life chill you to the bone, surely one step

Şölen Salonu~
This room was meant to hold victory celebrations and welcome important
guests, used by the Lord of the tower and soldiers alike.  It now lies in ruins
as much of the rest of the tower.  Banners of depicting great battles and
fanciful creatures and places once lined it's walls, now it walls are lined
with dried blood and grey rags.  Once, this tower was one of the Seven Towers
of Malkeri, now a ruin in the Blight.

Lord'un Odası~
The Lord of the tower lived here, and in a fashion still does, the room is
immaculate, it's furnishings still intact, and banners as colorful as if newly
woven.  A large bed is made in the middle of the room.  The air seems to shiver
with life and anger at someone daring to enter this room.  The air becomes
clearer, as does a shape forming beside the bed.  Malkerians were ever a
stubborn lot.

You stand atop one of the Seven Towers of the lost kingdom of Malkeri.
Once this tower overlooked farms and houses of the Malkerians, now it overlooks
the desolation of the Blight, the Land of the Shadow.  The battlements
themselves are blackened as if by huge gouts of fire, your heart sinks with
desperation and a sense of loss for the broken kingdom, and it's brave people.

Bir Merdiven Boşluğu~
Now well into the tower the light has faltered, as you weave your way
through the oppressive darkness of the tower.  Here a stairway leads up into
the tower.  The walls are still streaked with blood, and the occasional Trolloc
symbols written in the blood of the dead.

You are now in a hallway in the basement of the tower.  Faded banners and
black streaks of dried blood line the walls.  A set of stairs can be seen off
to the south leading up into the tower.  To the north you see a door adorned
with two crossed swords, now covered in blood.  The hallway continues to the
west.
