A grotesque and disturbing site meets you eyes here.  The Blight still
surrounds you all of it's death and decay strong in your mind.  But, what lies
to the west is perhaps the most disturbing of all.  You are standing on the
shore of the Dead Sea.  It's black and lifeless waters are perfectly still like
a huge mirror of pollished obsidian.  It's calm and lack of life chill you to
the bone, surely one step into those evil waters would mean your death.

fools and highly-trained Warders enter this far into the Blight, and even

Near the Seven Towers~
You stand only a few miles from the Seven Towers of the once great
Malkeri.  Lakes surround the entire area, their waters dark and cloudy, so
dark they seem to swallow the light around them, seeming to reel and bubble
moving the shadowy water to small waves.  This far into the Blight live
creatures that could easily kill a dozen heavily armed Bordermen, creatures
created by the Dark One to watch over his land.

Among the Seven Towers~
You now ride along the bases of the Seven Towers, once the kingdom of
Malkeri held back the tides of Shadowspan relentlessly seeking to crush the
lands to the south.  It's power now broken the Towers are in ruins, lying on
top of the foothills leading to the Mountains of Dhoom, all but two are utterly
destroyed, the two standing towers are to the east and west.  The taint of the
Shadow is much heavier now, you feel the evil now living in Malkeri. All the
trees and plants in this area are only barely holding on, decay taking them as
quickly as they grow.  Waves roll along the Hundred Lakes, and hope is far
away.

The Lord's Quarters~
The Lord of the tower lived here, and in a fashion still does, the room is
immaculate, it's furnishings still intact, and banners as colorful as if newly
woven.  A large bed is made in the middle of the room.  The air seems to shiver
with life and anger at someone daring to enter this room.  The air becomes
clearer, as does a shape forming beside the bed.  Malkerians were ever a
stubborn lot.

The Battlements~
You stand atop one of the Seven Towers of the lost kingdom of Malkeri.
Once this tower overlooked farms and houses of the Malkerians, now it overlooks
the desolation of the Blight, the Land of the Shadow.  The battlements
themselves are blackened as if by huge gouts of fire, your heart sinks with
desperation and a sense of loss for the broken kingdom, and it's brave people.

looking fireplace.  You feel quite strange.  The man is oblivious to you, and
you are unable to enter further into the room.  You have never seen the man
before, but you sense he is a man great power.  The kind who contols other men
and women fates with uncommon ease, sitting before a glowing screen, working
some strange plate before him.

The corrupted trees of the Blight sway in the wind, leaves and branches
seeming to grab at you as you pass by them.  Your nightmares seem like fanciful
daydreams compared to the evil that has siezed this land.  Only fools and
highly trained Warders enter this far into the Blight, and even the Warders
deadly skills are sometimes not enough to keep them alive.

A Strange Room~
You are awed by what you see before you, and a little confused.  Lighted
boxes line a large room.  Lights of all colors blink on the boxes,  two men sit
at a table on the far side of the room.  They do not notice you, and you cannot
seem to get thier attention.  More importantly, as you look at some of the
windows in the room, you see great battles taking place, people you know
talking back in the town you come from, people living and dying, being reborn,
and dying again.  And the men in the room don't even notice!  You feel a great
need to leave this place.

others do not even notice you and move by the glass surrounding you without a

You have reached the beginning of Tarwin's Gap.  The largest pass in the
Mountains of Dhoom.  Many great battles have taken place in this gap.
Traditionally the Malkerians defended this gap.  Once that that kingdom fell
the duty fell to the borderland kingdom of Shienar.  You see more than a fist
of Trollocs camped in the gap.  Going further to the north would be suicide.
With the Dragonwall to the east, and the Mountains of Dhoom to the north, you
must turn back.

The Blight~
This area of the Blight seems like all the others at first, death and
disease reigning everywhere.  Then you notice a small outcrop of rock that
seems out of place.  Upon closer inspection you realize it is man made,
appearantly the top of a tower, now buried deep in the earth.  What lost
kingdom must this have belonged to?

crushed them in the room to the north.  You eye what was once an stout wooden
door, reinforced with iron bars, smashed now into kindling.  To the east and
west are two small doors, probably guard rooms, while to the south you see a
massive iron portcullis, still intact, and rusted completely shut, it's opening
mechanism either destroyed by the defenders of the tower, or possibly it's

To the north lay the Mountains of Dhoom, that few men have travelled north of,
and even less have returned.  But, what lies to the west is perhaps the most
disturbing of all.  You are standing on the shore of the Dead Sea.  It's black
and lifeless waters are perfectly still like a huge mirror of pollished
obsidian.  It's calm and lack of life chill you to the bone, surely one step
into those evil waters would mean your death.

The Barracks~
This is were the soldiers of the tower made thier home while in the service
of the Tower's Lord.  The floor is covered with the rubble of old furnishings
and the occasional skeleton.  Looking more closely at a section of the northern
wall you notice a small patch of writing that reads "Lies, lies - where is the
power I was promised?"

This room is in amazingly good shape, appearantly these men were not in
thier quarters when the final assault took place.  You can see that the room
held four men.  Bunks and lockers are in each corner of the room, disturbed,
but not destroyed.

Now well into the tower the light has faltered, as you weave your way
through the oppressive darkness of the tower.  Here a stairway leads down into

symbols written in the blood of the dead.

door stands seemingly untouched by the towers fall, the hallway continues to

The Feast Hall~
This room was meant to hold victory celebrations and welcome important
guests, used by the Lord of the tower and soldiers alike.  It now lies in ruins
as much of the rest of the tower.  Banners of depicting great battles and
fanciful creatures and places once lined it's walls, now it walls are lined
with dried blood and grey rags.  Once, this tower was one of the Seven Towers
of Malkeri, now a ruin in the Blight.

The Lord of the tower lived here, and in a fashion still does, the room is
immaculate, it's furnishings still intact, and banners as colorful as if newly
woven.  A large bed is made in the middle of the room.  The air seems to shiver
with life and anger at someone daring to enter this room.  The air becomes
clearer, as does a shape forming beside the bed.  Malkerians were ever a
stubborn lot.

The Battlements~
You stand atop one of the Seven Towers of the lost kingdom of Malkeri.
Once this tower overlooked farms and houses of the Malkerians, now it overlooks
the desolation of the Blight, the Land of the Shadow.  The battlements
themselves are blackened as if by huge gouts of fire, your heart sinks with
desperation and a sense of loss for the broken kingdom, and it's brave people.
