You walk on a small dirt path that winds through the now decaying garden.
Every couple of feet a dead branch or shrubbery blocks the path. The
garden is a deadly quiet. The birds no longer sing, and the crickets no
longer chirp. This is definitely not the same garden that Xiang Fung left
so long ago.
