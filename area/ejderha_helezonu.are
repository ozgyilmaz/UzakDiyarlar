The Eternity Dragon is by far the largest dragon you have ever seen or heard
of. Its body easily stretching 300 feet from nose to tail.  This entire cavern,
which seems to span the distance of about three levels of this mountain, is
completely filled by the dragon.  At the time it seems peaceful, but you
can tell that attacking it would be the dumbest, and last thing you ever did.

This path appears to be very old, and well travelled. It amazes you that you
have never noticed it was here before.  That is until you look back and
realize that the clay road is completely invisible to you from here.  To the
east, the path continues.  It appears that the western opening you entered
through is now impassible.  You are here whether you like it or not....
     There is a small (Glowing) (Humming) tablet.

The path is becoming more and more difficult to traverse now, as the trees seem
to reach out to strangle you.  You feel like you are utterly alone, and, if not
for the mountain you can now see in the distance, would probably just recall to
Midgaard.  But then again, who ever said that adventuring was easy?

is by ripping of a piece of cloth, and covering your mouth and nose with it as
you walk.  Far above you, you see what must be the Mağara Girişi.

Now that you have something to somthing to concentrate upon, scaling the
mountain, you are actually able to think more clearly.  You have encountered
dragons before, and vanquished them, why should these be any different.
This thought continues rolling through your mind, but as you reach the next
level of the cliff, it does little to ease your fear.

The first thing you are aware of is that the mountain itself seems to breathe.
In and out goes its breath, constantly in and out.  You suddenly hear footsteps
approaching from all around you, and brace for combat.  It takes you a few
moments to realize that the sound was your heart beating.

with many differing shades of red or brown, with a few frost particles
glittering on one of the walls.  Even with the cloth, the smell of the dragons
is almost unbearable.

You are beginning to feel very unnerved.  Since you have been walking through
DragonSpyre, the screams had been slowly dying off, and now they are no more.
Normally the lack of death cries would be a welcome change, only now they
have been replaced by a very eerie silence.  You don't like this one bit.

This cave is really starting to get on your nerves.  With each new step, you
hear what sounds like giggling coming from all sides, goading you onward.
Daring you to learn the secrets that DragonSpyre has held for the past three
hundred years.  "They are only dragons."

You have reached a fork in the path through DragonSpyre.  You can't be sure
which way you should go, but the odd scraching sound to the east makes
you want to go west.  The giggling that has been following you around has
now become a full blown laugh.   "They are ONLY dragons."

The walls are blank and featureless, solid rock that has not been touched
for unknown centuries.  The floor is scuffed and scraped from thousands
of claws passing over it.  The ceiling is out of sight, the cave is obviously
made for something well beyond human size.  "They are only dragons."

The Lair of the White Dragon~
You have managed, through luck(?), to find the lair of the white dragon.  It
stands before you, glaring at you with its pale blue eyes.  All around, the
walls are coated with a thick layer of ice.  You slip several times before
gaining your balance enough to face the fearsome beast.  Will you fight it,
or flee?  "It is JUST a dragon."

You should read room descriptions more often.
The acid cascades over your body, and burns the skin from the muscle,
then the muscle from the bone.  You have never experienced this much

The hallway here is colder than the rest of the cave.  You assume that the

was still intact.  You begin to hope that it wasn't a baby....

The hallway here is a radical change from where you just where.  Here,
the walls look much more undeveloped than the last hallway you were in.
It feels like time itself is slowing down.  The hallway looks like it goes on
for all eternity, but at the sluggish pace you are moving, eternity might
not be that long of a distance.

The hallway here is a radical change from where you just where.  Here,
the walls look much more undeveloped than the last hallway you were in.
It feels like time itself is slowing down.  The hallway looks like it goes on
for all eternity, but at the sluggish pace you are moving, eternity might
not be that long of a distance.

Lair of the Copper Dragon~
Within the bounds of this room, time has seemed to stop.  There is no
movement, save for the large mass at the back of the room.  Out of the
corner of you eye, you manage to catch a glimpse of a droplet of water
"falling" from a stalagtite...it appears to have been in the same position
for the past century.  You have no chance to move before the Dragon strikes.

Treasure Room~
All about you are the untold fortunes of many generations of families.
Nothing here seems to be touched by age, it is all in perfect condition.        It has remained as it was many years ago when it was taken.  Although the       Dragon and the original families considered these items "treasure", you
manage to find little of value beside a pile of gold coins you collect.

The throne room is remarkably well kempt considering the anarchy
of the Pixie hierarchy.  The power of the time dragon does not seem
to affect this room in the least bit.  There is a humongous throne
sitting at the far end of the room.  There appears to be a Pixie
