lord krotgar~
Lord Krotgar~
Lord Krotgar burada, nefretle g�l�ms�yor.
~
Krothgar, standing at over eight feet tall and clad in full spiked black
plate mail, is an imposing... man. It is said his fists have the power to
rend the very earth asunder if he is angered. It is small wonder the dark
powers have chosen him as their fell agent on Anon.

�l�m ��valyesi burada, �eytanca g�l�ms�yor.
~
This fellow and his comrades are servants of the demon lord Marmandes, and
will take only his orders, despite the fact that Krothgar could probably
crush him (and definitely them) with little effort. Krothgar tolerates their
presence in honor of the alliance he has forged with the dark powers to
facilitate the conquest of Anon.

~
This soulless automaton was created by Krothgar's fell scientist-mages to
serve him as a bodyguard (for appearance's sake only- he scarcely has need
of one) and an executioner. It will kill on a command.

�blis Prens Marmandes~
�blis Prens Marmandes burada, seni izliyor!
~
Marmandes has been sent here by his evil masters to observe and aid their
servant Krothgar, and as such he will prefer to avoid direct combat, being
greatly weaker on this plane than on his native, and being eager to see how
Krothgar performs. This does not mean that he will fail to defend himself
to the best of his considerable abilities if the need arises.

Even the mages of Krothgar know not of the existence of this secret tomb.
Buried within is the old lord of the Fortress, who was imprisoned in here
by the forces of Good ages ago. And now you have woken him up. Way to go
slick.

This soulless automaton was created by Krothgar's fell evil priests to
serve him as a bodyguard (for appearance's sake only- he scarcely has need
of one) and an executioner. It will kill on a command.

H�k�m Da�� D�zl�kleri Yak�n�nda~
You are heading directly toward Mount Doom, on a narrow path that leads to
the desolate, monster-infested plains that surround it. This is the fell
domain of Lord Krothgar, whose forbidding black fortress can be seen atop the
peak of the extinct volcano called by humans Mount Doom. Armies of giants
patrol the lower slopes, while evil mutants, mages and demons guard the
fortress itself. Steeling yourself, you push on.

You are standing inside the gates of the fortress, at a crossroads. The
passages are remarkably plain for a den of evil- simply dressed grey flag
stones on floor and walls, the monotony broken only by the occasional torch
sconce or tattered tapestry. It is evident that this castle has known many
inhabitants prior to its current ones.

Laboratuvar�n Do�u Sonu~
This vast room extends in all directions. You see vats, urns, beakers, jars,
alembics and a hundred other items scattered about on desks, benches, chairs
and floors. Everything appears rather damaged, as if someone (or something)
has recently gone berserk in here...

Yeralt� T�rbesi~
This crypt has remained untouched for centuries. It houses the remains of
the foul lich king who once ruled this Fortress and much of the surrounding
land under an iron fist (literally, Krothgar's golem now wears it). You
better hope he stayed dead...

You have entered the grounds of the unholy temple of the Fortress. Screaming
virgins are torn asunder in foul rituals upon altars soaked with the blood
of thousands of innocents while evil priests look on and pray for a visitation

The altar is directly before you, and you see the high priest standing
behind it, about to sacrifice another virgin.
