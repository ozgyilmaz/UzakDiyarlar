You are in the shipyards of Freeport. About you in dry storage are many
vessels either in repair or in the process of being developed. Of particular
interest is the deep-keeled prototype vessel currently under construction.
You get the sense that sailing as you know it is about to change. Many of
the islanders are employed here, and ages range from the youthful 12 year
old apprentice, to the grizzled old shipwrights.

The city itself has been built on the highest part of the island. The city
has walls, made of the local slate and a mortar joint. Roads stretch off

warehouse, and westward wharf road continues along the harbor.

You dodge porters and errand boys in the whirling mayhem of the mercantile
warehouse. Longshoremen load crates of cargo into horse drawn carts and
lead the teams down to the wharf for embarking vessels. The cargomaster
signals to his apprentices in a strange sign language of the merchants
guild. You get caught up in the excitement of the warehouse, and lend a
hand to two struggling boys.

Here, amid the reek of spilled beer, bad cigars, and other unmentionable
smells lies an endearing little bar done up in a nautical theme. The jolly
roger flies over the main bar, where the local beer and wine is served
as the locals like it- warm. Waitresses clad in little wiggle between
the packed tables to the delight of their naval and mercantile clientele.
An unleavened spiced bread called Pilas is served hot and in generous portions
in wicker baskets.

You stand inside the town hall of the city of Freeport. Town hall
is arranged for meetings. To your left are the 9 captains chairs, where
the representatives of the Captains guild sit. To your right are the
5 chairs of the merchants guild. Ahead, in the center, is where the mayor
sits. Around you are many wooden benches upon which townsmen may sit and
participate in the meetings. The role of the mayor is as arbitrator, and

You have entered the grand arch of the merchants guild of Freeport. It is
here that the master traders conduct their business of contracting with
captains for the transport of cargo to remote destinations. Each member of
the merchant's guild tithes to the guild, money which is used to not
only maintain the guild proper, but also to open new markets in foreign
lands. The guild masters command much respect, wealth, and power throughout
the world. Guild matters are decided by a vote, scaled by the wealth of
each master. The 5 richest masters make up the council of 5, and argue on
the guilds behalf in contractual negotiations in town meetings. It has been
said that the council of 5 collectively owns one quarter of the world's
wealth.

Here in the halls of the Captains guild, the worlds shipping begins and
ends. The guild was founded over 300 years ago to represent the collective
interests of the ship owners. To be a member, one must demonstrate the
clear title to at least one vessel. Ahead of you is the great hall where
the guild holds its meetings. Votes in the guild are based weighted by
the number of vessels the captain has. The richest men with the most ships
fill the 9 seats of honor in the guild, and are called the Admirals. It has
been said that they control one third of the world's shipping.
