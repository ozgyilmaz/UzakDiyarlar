the village flint-knapper~
The village flint-knapper is here repairing crude tools.

While the knapper's primary job is to craft tools for the village, such is
his skill that he may also be able to repair your equipment. Contact with

remarkably conversant with the properties of metals such as copper and silver
and alloys such as bronze.

much. In fact, to these villagers it is about as far as you can see on a
clear day).

The art of brewing is held sacred by the northern tribes, and the brewers
are considered holy men. In accordance with their beliefs, the brewers hand
out samples of their sacred draught to all who pass by, and while there is
no real cost, a small "donation" to the sacred coffer is expected. And when
the brewer is the size of a grizzly bear, few refuse.

This strapping giant of a woman has flaming red hair and biceps bigger than
your thighs. She has ruled this village wisely for many years, through lean

You cough as you enter the smoky interior of this cramped hut, your eyes
watering as the odor of some bubbling concoction in an iron cauldron wafts
toward you. In the center of this hut the shaman awaits, quietly meditating.
A variety of furs, bones, charms and trinkets line the walls, doubtless
serving as focii for the shaman's mystic powers.

A Path in the Village~
You are strolling along a path in the village. Flecks of white snow are blown
about on the hard ground by a chill northern breeze that blows in from the
icy mountains far to the north. You hope that you will be able to find
a hot meal and a comfortable bed this evening. Several children suddenly
rush by, immersed in some strange activity, the rules of which are quite
unfathomable to you.

You are greeted with a sudden blast of heat from the furnace as you enter
the smithy. Wiping sweat from your brow, you gaze about, taking the place
in. Various items of armor in various stages of repair line the walls. A
huge, muscular man is using a massive hammer to beat the dents out of a
suit of rather battered-looking bronze plate. The flint-knepper has learnt
skills far more advanced than his contemporaries, thanks to the many
visitors this village attracts, and his forge shows evidence of this.

The Kitchen~
In here several teenagers of both sexes rush about preparing the evening
meal under the watchful eye of a hefty cook, who helps them along with the
occasional shout or cuff on the ear.

A Path in the Village~
You are strolling along a path in the village. Flecks of white snow are blown
about on the hard ground by a chill northern breeze that blows in from the
icy mountains far to the north. You hope that you will be able to find
a hot meal and a comfortable bed this evening.

Outside a Village Clan Hut~
You are standing outside a hut in the village. It is a wooden walled structure
with a thatched roof, and a sturdy oak door. Occasionally a villager enters
or exits the hut, sparing you a curious glance as they do. A crude etching
upon the doors of this hut marks it as the Wolf Clan hut.

Inside the Hut~
You are standing inside the hut. The sounds and smells of cooking emanate
from the east, while quiet conversation can be heard to the west. You feel
slightly nervous about intruding upon this clan, but then again that's
what your profession is all about, really. Intruding.
