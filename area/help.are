-1 GOLD SILVER MONEY~
.
	Selenge's economy is based on gold and silver coinage (and the lowly
copper, which you as an adventurer are far too proud to carry). Gold coins are
worth 100 silver coins, but are also four times as heavy (25 to the pound, as
opposed to 100 to the pound for silver). Gems can be bought to alleviate weight
problems from the Selenge jeweller, he charges a mere 10% more than they are
worth. 10 gems weigh one pound, and they can be worth more than 100 gold pieces
for the highest quality stones.
~

0 BRIEF COMPACT~
.
    Brief and compact help set your display options for the game. Typing brief
toggles on and off the showing of room descriptions when you move around
(considerably reducing the text to be processed), and typing compact
removes the extra blank line before your prompt.
~

-1 DEAF~
.
  The deaf toggle turns off incoming tells, helpfull if you are being bombarded
by messages from other players.  You can still use reply (see 'help reply') to
reply to people who were telling you before you went deaf, although you
cannot reply to a deaf person unless you or they are a diety (it's mostly
useful for sending a quick "I'm being spammed so I went deaf" message to
a person).
~


0 PROMPT~
Syntax: prompt
Syntax: prompt all
Syntax: prompt <%*>

PROMPT with out an argument will turn your prompt on or off.

PROMPT ALL will give you the standard "<hits mana moves>" prompt.

PROMPT <%*> where the %* are the various variables you may set yourself.

        %h :  Display your current hits
        %H :  Display your maximum hits
        %m :  Display your current mana
        %M :  Display your maximum mana
        %v :  Display your current moves
        %V :  Display your maximum moves
        %x :  Display your current experience
	%X :  Display experience to level
        %g :  Display your gold held
	%s :  Display silver carried
        %a :  Display your alignment
	%y :  Display your percent hit
        %o :  Display opponents percent hit
        %r :  Display the room name you are in
	%e :  Display the exits from the room in NESWDU style
	%c :  Display a carriage return (useful for multi-line prompts)
        %R :  Display the vnum you are in (IMMORTAL ONLY)
        %z :  Display the area name you are in (IMMORTAL ONLY)
	%n :  Display your name
	%S :  Display your sex

Example:  PROMPT <%hhp %mm %vmv>
        Will set your prompt to "<10hp 100m 100mv>"

0 DEATH~
.
	When your character dies, you are reincarnated back at the altar of the
temple of your hometown. Your corpse is left behind in the room where you were
killed, together with all of your equipment.

	Any spells which were affecting you are canceled by death.
	Following and groups are not affected by death.
	You lose experience points for dying.  The amount you lose depends on
your then experience points, your race, class and your previous deaths.
	After each three deaths if you are a samurai your charisma reduces by
one, otherwise your constitution decreases by one. 10 deaths brings a samurai
a permanant death. But a samurai can decrease the number of deaths by solving
some quests.
	Corpses decay after time, but the objects inside corpses fall to the
ground.

~

0 LIGHT~
.
        In order to be able to see in the dark, you have to either hold
a light, or wear a glowing object on your head.

0 EXPERIENCE LEVEL XP~
.
	Your character advances in power by gaining experience.  You need a set
amount of experience points for each level based on your race and class.
You gain experience by:

	Being part of a group that kills a monster

You lose experience by:

	Fleeing from combat
	Recalling out of combat
	Being the target of certain spells
	Dying

	The experience you get from a kill depends on several things:

	How many players are in your group
	Your level versus the level of the monster
	Your alignment versus the monster's alignment
	Your hitpoint when the monster was dead
	and some random variation.

Note that:
    A group which consist of two player will REDUCE your experience points
by an amount of 25% of real exp which got if alone.
    A group which consist of three player will REDUCE your experience points
by an amount of 50% of real exp which got if alone.
~


0 PET PETS~
.
	You can buy pets in the pet shop.  You may own only one pet at a time,
after the old one dies you may purchase a replacement.
~



0 TICK~
.
	Many of the game actions are based upon interval timers, including
combat, most autonomous monster actions, hp/mana/move regeneration, spell
duration, weather, and area resetting.

	Of these timers, the hp/mana/move regeneration timer is popularly
called the 'tick'.

	Area resetting happens roughly every 106 sec. if no one is in the area;
less often (15 minutes) if some one is.  Also note that objects lying on
the ground will not be regenerated if anyone is in the area when it resets.

0 SHOOT THROW STUCK 'STUCK IN'~
Syntax: shoot <direction> <target>
Syntax: throw spear <direction> <target>

	In order to be able to shoot, you should wield bow to your pro-hand
and arrow to the other hand. In order to throw spear, you should wield the
spear to your pro-hand. The direction is the throwing or the shooting
direction. The target (2.cityguard) is counted from the room that you are
in. When a victim is stuck by the spear or arrow, it may be stuck in the
body of the victim. In order to remove th stuck in arrow or spear, one
should just type 'remove arrow' or 'remove spear'. If you don't remove
the stuck in item, it will decrease your hitroll, damroll as well as it
will decrease the hitpoint gain. Of course the stuck arrows and spears
inflict damages initially as well. However the mobiles start tracking
the shooter. You can shoot as far range as you can SCAN.
~

0 CAST~
Syntax: cast <spell> <target>

	Before you can cast a spell, you have to practice it. The more you
practice, the higher chance you have of success when casting.  Casting spells
costs mana. The mana cost decreases as your level increases. Also, some skills
may increase the power of your spell.

	The <target> is optional.  Many spells which need targets will use an
appropriate default target, especially during combat. Some spells targets are
rooms, so you don't need a target at all. In order to see the affections of
rooms type RAFFECT.

	In addition you can cast offensive spells to the other rooms as well.

	cast 'acid blast' n.2.fido

	Means, cast the 'acid blast' spell to the fido, who is in the north
direction and counting this room it is the second fido. You can cast as far
as you can see in the SCAN range. However the mobiles start tracking the
person that attacked itself.

	If the spell name is more than one word, then you must quote the spell
name. Example: cast 'cure critic' frag.  Quoting is optional for single-word
spells. You can abbreviate the spell name.

	When you cast an offensive spell, the victim usually gets a saving
throw. The effect of the spell is reduced or eliminated if the victim makes
the saving throw successfully.

See also the help sections for individual spells.

0 EXITS~
Syntax: exits

0 SCAN~
Syntax: scan <direction>

	Scan enables character to see the people around him. If you don't
give a direction as an argument, all directions will be scanned and the
result will be displayed. If you give an argument, then it will display
the mobiles only in that direction and it will display far in that direction
as well.
~

0 DROP GET GIVE PUT TAKE~
Syntax: drop <object>

PUT puts an object into a container, e.g:
	put banner pit		or	put banner in pit
	put banner sofa		or	put banner on sofa
	put all.ring pit	or	put all.ring on sofa

0 FLEE DISHONOR DISHONOUR RESCUE~

	Once you start a fight, you can't just walk away from it.  If the fight
is not going well, you can attempt to FLEE, or another character can RESCUE you.
(You can also RECALL, but this is less likely to work, and costs more experience
points, then fleeing).

	If you lose your link during a fight, then your character will keep
fighting, and will attempt to wimp out.Your chances of making the wimp out are
the same as you are not disconnected.

	If you are affected by pass door spell then you can flee passing the
closed doors. You cannot flee to inside of the cabals when you are fighting
with the cabal guardians.

	If you are Samurai, after level 10 you can NOT FLEE and NOT WIMP OUT,
so be careful. You may only dishonor yourself during the fight, if the victim's
level is much higher than you, or the total levels of the group that you are
fighting is higher than three times of your level.

	After you fled, the mobile won't forget you! The mobile will try to
track and find you, then attack you. Even if you quit, and reenter the game

as well. Please read 'MOBILE TRACK'.

perform any command.  The command may have arguments.  You are responsible
for the actions of your followers, and others who attack your followers
will incur the same penalty as if they attacked you directly.

	Most charmed creatures lose their aggresive nature (while charmed). But
intelligent mobiles can remember you and may try to attack you after the affect
of charm is passed.

may break the charm link.
~

0 REST SLEEP STAND WAKE~
Syntax: rest
Syntax: sleep

you regenerate hit points, mana points, and movement points faster. However,

15 minutes regardless, and is the preferred method of saving. Typing save
will block all other command for about 20 seconds, so use it sparingly.
You do not need to save. Every save operation requested by the players
causes lag. The Anatolia' auto saver does not cause even a tiny lag.

Some objects, such as keys and some maps, may not be saved. Those very
powerful items of very limited number, are not saved if you are below
level 10.

QUIT leaves the game.  You may QUIT anywhere.  When you re-enter the game
you will be back in the same room.

the ban list, if the remover is of equal or higher level than the banner.

by editing the player file) banned, by changing the argument after the site.
*s may be used to ban either by suffix (*.edu), prefix (labmac*), or
content (*andrews*), but be careful not to accidently lock out too many
sites with a wildcard.  Bans do not save unless the permban command is used.
~

99 REBOOT SHUTDOWN~

put in the room.  Mobiles are always put into the same room as the god. Old

structures. Type set <class> without an argument to see a listing of options.

forms of communication.

horrible effects on slow links. Teleport is a synonym for transfer.
~

94 AT~
Syntax: at <location> <command>

At executes the given command (which may have arguments) at the given
location.  The location may be specified as a vnum, as the name of

all characters in the same room as the user, with no indication of who sent
it.  Gecho does the same for all players connected to the game, and pecho
sends the message to the player specified as the target.  Any higher-level
god will see a prompt in front of your message, informing him or her that it
is an echo.
~

~
-1 HUMAN HUMANS MAN~

Humans are the most common race in the world, and make up the majority of
adventurers.  Although they have no special talents like the other races,
they are more versatile, being skilled in all classes.  Humans are able to
gain more benefit from magical devices.

~
-1 DWARF DWARVES~

Dwarves are short, stocky demi-humans, known for foul temper and great
stamina.  Dwarves have high strength and constitution, but poor dexterity.
They are not as smart as humans, but are usually wiser due to their long
lifespans.  Dwarves make lots of noise wherever they go and cannot be
thieves.  Dwarves can be good or neutral.
Dwarves are resistant to magic, poison and disease, but cannot swim, and so
are very vulnerable to drowning.  They can see in the dark with infravision.

~
-1 ELF ELVES~

Elves are slightly taller than humans, but have a much lighter build.  They
lack the strength and stamina of the other races, but are for more agile,
both in body and mind.
Elves resist charm spells most effectively, due to their magical nature.
However, they are burned by the touch of iron, and so are barred from the
use of iron in their adventuring careers.  Elves are notoriously
hard to spot and walk unnoticed automatically. They may see in the dark
with infravision.  Elves must stay good to cast any spells they know.
Elves who have turned to evil are frowned upon.

~
-1 'HALF-ELF' HALFELF HALFELVES~

Half-elves are a cross-breed between a human and an elf. They are not quite
as intelligent as pure elves but have a greater constitution. Like pure
elves, half-elves see in the dark with infravision.

~
-1 SVIRF SVIRFNEBLI DEEP-GNOME~

The Svirfnebli, also known as deep gnomes, have made their way into Anatolia as
the paths to the Underdark have been found.  Slighty larger than their
surface cousins, these gnomes are also stronger and a little more hearty from
centuries of working stone.  The dedication to stone has made them not
quite as adept mentally as their cousins, but yet they are still regarded
as very wise.  With their singular dedication to the stone, svirfnebli
must be neutral in all  aspects of their lives.  They have the same ability
in learning the powers of items as their surface cousins.

~
-1 FELAR~

The Felar are a race descended from the great cats. For long years in their
past, the Felar were enslaved by wizards to serve as familiars.  The scars
of this servitude still show in the relative weakness and dull wits of the
Felar.  They are renowned, however, for their agility and their "nine lives".
It is said a Felar can withstand blows in battle (or from an angry master)
that would kill a human outright.

The thick fur of the Felar makes them resistent to cold, but also very
vulnerable to fire.  They also abhor water and are liable to drown in it.
Despite heavy modification by their former masters, the Felar retain the
large claws and fangs of their ancestors.  This gives them the ability to
inflict extra damage during a fight, but the claws are not retractable so
it is difficult for a Felar to walk unnoticed.  The Felar are also famed for
their street fighting ability.  The Felar do not have the discipline or wits
to be pure magic-users, and some of the Felar still resent the mages, anyway.
The wars of freedom were long ago, however, so many younger Felar are willing
to forgive and forget, and some have even begun to dabble in the magic that
once imprisoned them.

~
-1 DUERGAR DARK-DWARF DARK-DWARVES~

With the recent excavations unearthing paths to the Underdark, the race of
dark dwarves known as Duergar has made its way into Anatolia.  Like their
surface cousins they are strong, though their evil ways have changed them
in other areas.  Unlike their cousins, they are not known for working stone
and metal, something which has made them less hearty over time.  They have
become more dexterous through centuries of thievery and deceit.  All Duergar
are evil.

~
-1 'DARK-ELF' DARKELF DARKELVES DARK~

Dark-elves are a race of renegade elves who have turned their energy toward
evil.  They are inherently intelligent but have neglected intellectual
studies and become very nimble from years of generations of thievery and
mischief.  Like elves, dark-elves have infravision and can walk unnoticed.

turn to good are frowned upon.  Dark-Elves are burned by the touch of
mithril.

-1 ROCKSEER ROCKSEERS~

and become very translucent from years of generations of trying to pass
rocks.  Like elves, rockseers have infravision and can walk innocent and
can pass doors easily.Rockseers must stay neutral to cast any spells they
might know. And because of their organism they are vulnerable to woods.
They have a specific spell called 'meld into stone'.

~
-1  TROLL TROLLS~
Long hidden within the sanctity of their mountain caves, a race known in the
past only as a myth, lies the civilization of the trolls. Built with the
undying stamina of the mountains they reside in, these green skinned beasts
often grow to obtain a state of health few other races believed possible.
Hindered by their slow intellect and mobility, the troll society seems to
have decided as a whole to rejoin the races of the realms, moving out of
their sanctuaries in numbers reaching high into the thousands

Outdoorsmen, hunters, master of woodcraft, Rangers are the guardians of
the forests.  In addition to having excellent fighting skills, they are
also wielders of some powerful magic.  Some Rangers have been known to call
large bears to their aid, fashion mystical staves, and be able to camouflage
beyond detection.  Their ability to ambush opponents makes them deadly
foes.

-1 NINJA NINJAS~
                               NINJA
Masters of the art of weaponless combat, these mysterious warriors have
recently become more common in the land.  They strike quickly and
silently before fading into the shadows.  Ninjas are skilled in the
knowledge of nerve pressure, and can weaken their foes with a well placed
strike.  Wielders of a dark magic, they have spells that no wizards of
today can duplicate.  At high levels, Ninjas learn the art of
assassination, killing their foe instantly and silently.  Due to their
belief that touching the blades of their opponent with their own blade is
a loss of honor, Ninjas cannot parry with swords.

~
-1 ANTI-PALADIN ANTI-PALADINS ANTIPALADIN ANTIPALADINS ANTI~
                          - ANTI-PALADIN -
The opposite of Paladins, these knights have chosen evil as their course.
Such fervor and zeal gives them deadly spells to compliment their already
superb fighting skills.  They seek only personal gain and to cause suffering
and pain to good.  Anti-paladins must stay evil in order to cast their
spells. Those who forsake evilness are frowned upon. Anti-paladins can try
to threathen the mobiles, and can get their equipments by demanding it from
them.

chivalrous, humble, merciful, kind, bold, and noble of spirit.  Paladins

~
-1 CLERIC CLERICS~

Clerics are the most defensively oriented of all the classes.  Most of their
spells focus on healing or defending the faithful, with their few combat
spells being far less powerful than those of mages. However, clerics are the
best class by far at healing magics, and they possess an impressive area of
protective magics, as well as fair combat prowess.

~
-1 THIEF THIEVES~

Thieves are a marginal class. They do few things better than any other class,
but have the widest range of skills available.  Thieves are specialists at
thievery and covert actions, being capable of entering areas undetected where
more powerful adventurers would fear to tread.  They are better fighters than
clerics, but lack the wide weapon selection of warriors.

~
-1 WARRIOR WARRIORS~

Warriors live for combat and the thrill of battle. They are the best fighters
of all the classes, but lack the subtle skills of thieves and the magical
talents of mages and priests.  Warriors are best for those who don't mind

See also: ROLEPLAYING GROUP ALIGNMENT~

0 ALIGNMENT~
In the interest of attracting the right caliber of followers, the
immortals of Anatolia have outlined the following alignments.  See where
you think you fit in.

Lawful Good:   An orderly, strong society with a well-organized government
	       can make life better for the majority of the people.  To ensure
	       the quality of life, laws must be created and obeyed.  When
	       people respect the laws, and try to help each other, society as
	       whole prospers.

Lawful Neutral:  Also believes in a strong, well-organized government, whether
	       it is a tyranny or democracy.  Organization and regimentation
	       bring benefits that outweigh any moral questions raised by
	       their actions.

Lawful Evil:   The use of society and its laws for personal benefit.  Structure
	       and organization elevate those who deserve to rule as well as
	       provide a clearly defined hierarchy between master and servant.
	       Laws and societies are supported so long as they fit with
	       personal concerns.  Laws are obeyed out of fear of punishment.

Neutral Good:  A balance of forces is important, but the concerns of laws and
	       chaos do not moderate the need for good.  The universe is vast
	       and contains many creatures striving for different goals, so a
	       pursuit of good will not upset the balance.  Fostering good may
	       mean supporting an organized society, or overthrowing the
	       existing social order.  Social structure has no innate value.

True Neutral:  Almost impossible to find such people as the majority of people
	       make judgments.  It is their duty to see that all of the forces
	       (evil, good, law, and chaos) remain in balance.  Alliances with
	       such people are odd, as they tend to switch sides as one side
	       brings the other to the point of destruction.

Neutral Evil:  The primary concern for such people is their own advancement.
	       Working with others or on their own, their only interest is
	       getting ahead.  Such people are known for their 'Me, Myself,
	       and I' personalities.  No scruples, no conscience.

Chaotic Good:  Strong individualists marked with a streak of kindness and
	       benevolence.  Goodness and right matter, but there is little
	       use for laws and regulations.  Their actions are morally good
	       but may not be in perfect agreement with the rest of society.

Chaotic Neutral:  There is no order to anything, even their own actions.
	       Good and Evil are irrelevant when making a decision.  They
	       are almost totally unreliable, except for the fact that you
	       can rely on them being like this.  The true coin-flipper, they
	       rely on fate and chance to lead them.

Chaotic Evil:  The bane of all that is good and organized.  Laws and
	       governments are the tools of weaklings unable to fend for
	       themselves.  The strong have a right to what they want, and
	       weak are there to be exploited.  Leadership among CEs is based
	       on power, with the leader capable of bullying his underlings
	       into obedience.

Each god may accept a follower based on these outlines.

0 RULES~
These are the rules of the Realms of Anatolia. Disobeying is grounds
for deletion. For other matters, use common sense.

1. Remember that this is a roleplaying atmosphere.  If an immortal imposes
   their will upon you, you must do it.  Do not ask a wizi-invis god 'who they
   are'.  This is question is considered rude and will not be answered.
2. Immortals often make announcements via notes, and you are required to
   follow accordingly.  Not having read the notes is no excuse.  It is the
   same as if the Immortal told you in person.
3. Player stealing and killing is permitted and encouraged.
4. Do not use charmed pets to PK people who are out of your PK range.
   If a person is not in your pk range, and they do not initiate an attack on
   your group member, then your pets had better not touch them.
5. Your presence here is a privilege not a right.  Obey any orders from gods,
   and you will be fine.
6. MULTICHARRING: You may have more than one character, but you may not use
   multiple logins from same terminal. Punishment for this rule is
   deleting of one char. In addition make sure that roleplaying is done
   perfectly for all your chars.
7. Anyone who assists people in multicharing, i.e. holding equipment while
   they transfer it, 'looking the other way', etc will be punished harshly.
8. DO NOT, in any way, shape or form, exploit bugs.  It WILL result in a
   punishment determined by IMPLEMENTORS.  Repeat DO NOT exploit bugs, you
   WILL be IMMEDIATELY punished.
9. SPAMMING IS ILLEGAL.  (Spam filling up someone's screen with needless
   repetion of anything)  You will be given one warning and then deleted.
   Don't do it.
10. Sexual harrassment will not be tolerated.  If both parties do not consent
    to the socials/emotes, then don't do them.
11. Cheating will not be tolerated. This includes accepting favors from
    gods and exploiting bugs.
12. Play as your character should play. If your lawful good, play like a
    lawful good. Opposing roleplaying will instantly be punished! If you
    go on doing such things, your character's access may be denied!

  These are simple, clear rules.  If you violate them you WILL be
  punished.  Punishments may vary, depending on previous rules violations,
  the situation.  Be prepared for the worst if you are caught breaking
  these rules.

  Changes  to these rules are at the discretion of the immortals, and
  may be done withoutwarning, notice, or even evidence of sanity.

0 LAWS LAW ~
The laws of the land that shall be enforced by the Ruler Cabal are as
follows :

    The areas that are defined as protected by the jurisdiction of the Law
are the entirety of Selenge, New Thalos, Valley of Titans and  New Ofcol.

1. No Player Killing/Stealing/Looting in any protected area.  Theft is fully
   illegal.  This includes the attempt of stealing any from a person OR looting
   a player's corpse OR looting the pit when a player's equipment has returned
   from their decayed corpse.  Stealing also includes taking a disarmed weapon
   or equipment during a legal duel that is not your own.  Looting a criminal's
   corpse is unlawful within the towns.  You will be held responsible for your
   groupmate's actions.

2. No offensive area spells or harmful powers will be used in any protected
   area.  This includes area spells from charmed, summoned or attacked mobs.
   Aggressive mobs may not be summoned/brought into any protected area.

3. Aiding known criminals in any way by directly giving them equipment,
   helping them to elude punishment, to kill Ruler guards, etc. will result
   in a WANTED flag.

4. Intrusion into the Ruler Cabal is considered illegal and an attack upon
   the laws themselves. Remember that Rulers' cabal area is in the protected
   area, as well.

5. A dispersal that teleports the victim from a protected area directly into
   the room of an aggressive mob that causes their death is considered a
   player kill and will result in a WANTED flag on the caster.

6. Garbling Ruler members is against the law.  This prevents them from
   doing their job and is considered an offensive attack upon the law itself.

   Enforcement of these laws will be carried out by Ruler members. Selenge,
New Thalos, Valley of Titans and New Ofcol are defined by the 'where protector'
command. Old Selenge is not a holy town.

0 PHILOSOPHY~
Here is a general philosophy of each of the known cabals.

Ruler:  The enforcement of the laws above all.  The world exists in two
	halves: right and wrong.  The law comes first in all respects.
	They control and decide what is lawful or not.  Their word is law.

BattleRager:  BattleRagers live for combat, and look down on those who need
	      magic to survive.  They have a strong aversion to mage magic,
	      and are very wary of clerical magic.

Chaos:    Chaos wants to spread chaos throughout the land.  Not necessarily
	  evil, just against the orderwed society.  They feel that laws and
	  rules hamper freedom, and will go out of their way to see them
	  broken, or to cause chaos.

Knight:   Honor is valued above all else.  These fighting warriors seek to
	  right injustices and correct wrongs.  They follow the ideals of
	  the paladin.

Shalafi:  In Dark-Elf language, it means 'Master'. Discipline brings power.
          This is the motto of the Masters of Arcane Arts. The advancement
          of the Art is their motivation.  They look down on physical combat,
          preferring to use their magic.

Invader:  Invader is born to invade or massacre.  Establishment of its power
          over all is its goal.  Invader, in short, wants to control the world,
          but would never do so openly.

Hunter:   Mercenary of Anatolia. These pupils  kill any mobile and player
	  with the money that they will want. You may hire any of hunter
	  for above purpose.

Keep in mind these are only general guidelines.
