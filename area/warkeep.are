0 'The Keep of the Warlock'~
Many centuries ago, around the time of the Goblin Wars, which took the lives
of so many Elves, Dwarves and Humans on the Plains of Blood, there existed
a vile and crafty warlock named Baragar, and he resided in a fell keep
near the jagged peak of Mount Doom. By traveling to the past dimension, you
will have the chance to meet and slay this evil mercenary who worked against
his own race for the money of foul forces such as Krogthar, Jher and Lord
Vax. The warlock is not alone in his keep, however, and you will find
yourself pitted against many heinous foes in your journey.

warlock baragar~
the warlock Baragar~
The warlock Baragar chuckles at you and dares you to attack him.
~
Before you stands the master of the keep, Baragar the warlock. And while
Baragar is weak compared to sorcerers such as Krogthar and his minions,
or the vile Jher, he is no pushover either.

Baragar is a handsome young man with long white hair, and deep blue eyes.
He would appear to be almost angelic were it not for the diabolical gleam
to his eyes, and the evil grin on his thin, cruel lips.

the witch Alara~
A comely woman in her early twenties grins at you.
~
This woman is the witch Alara, associate and lover of Baragar. She is nude
save for a leather bandolier across her chest and buttocks, which contains
a variety of potions, scrolls and throwing daggers. She would be very
attractive if she didn't cackle insanely so much.

demon~
a demon~
A minor demon hisses and snarls at you.
~
Baragar and Alara managed to capture this demon and keep it in this room,
but they lacked the power necessary to control it, so they dare not release
it again. And now you're in here with this eight foot tall, four armed,
green skinned monstrosity from the lower planes. Great.

a asura guard~
A asura guard squints suspiciously at you.

These asuras are meant to prevent strangers from entering the inner keep,
but they see so many strange creatures here they aren't sure which type is
allowed and which isn't.

zombie servant~
a zombie servant~
A zombie servant gazes at you blankly.
~
This poor fellow was once a living servant of Baragar who made one mistake
too many. Baragar eventually decided undead staff were far more reliable,
if a little slower, and slew all his staff, turning them subsequently into
mindless undead. That's what a charming guy he is.

guard~
a keep guard~
A keep guard stands rigidly at attention here.
~
This guard is slightly bemused at your entrance, but doesn't move to stop
you- Baragar receives dozens of visitors daily, and if they are powerful
enough to slay him, then the guards certainly don't stand a chance, so they
keep quiet. You may wonder why in that case Baragar bothers having guards.
Well, so does he.

An apprentice mage looks up from her work, startled.

gender. She is small, cute, and evil.

The Path to the Keep~
You are heading toward a bleak blackstone keep, sitting in the middle of
a field of scorched earth. Surly guards patrol both on the battlements and
below before the gate, but they pay you little heed. Evidently the guards
are used to strange visitors...

plains of Past Anon. The ancient city of Thalos, ruined in your own time,
lies far to the south, while to the east lie the jagged peaks of the first
mountain range of Anon. It is rumored that the gods temselves reside at their
lofty peaks. Beyond them, you can see the peak of Mount Doom, whereupon
the castle of the dread Lord Krogthar is located.

You stand within the inner keep. The entry room is a small dark chamber,
with only four wooden doors to break the monotony of the black walls.

Guard Room~
here some of the asura guards of the inner keep reside. They dislike
intruders, though they are under orders from Baragar not to slay any, for
he is intensely curious as to the nature of any visitors, welcome or not.

Antechamber~
This small room is totally windowless, and would be utterly dark were it
not for your pale light source. You feel uneasy here. Far away, someone
screams, and you shiver uncomfortably.

Assassins' Quarters~
Here the assassins of Baragar reside, spending their spare time playing
cards, making poisons, killing peasant rabble captured by the guards, etc.
They will not be impressed by your intrusion...

Apprentice Quarters~
Here resides Alara's apprentice and sometime bed-partner. The apprentice
has little to do with Baragar, as Baragar envies and distrusts her, but he
dares not slay her for Alara would be displeased...

Baragar's Chambers~
Baragar himself resides here, in this small room. It is rather spartan,
furnished only with a small military cot, a desk and a shelf full of books.
You are surprised that such a wicked man would be so neat and disciplined.

Alara's Chamber~
Yang to Baragar's Yin, Alara's room represents just how different they are.
Her room is sloppy and messy, filled with useless junk and piles of unwashed
clothing. There are two large beds, covered with expensive silks and pillows.
A set of manacles hangs from one wall, used for some perversion you don't
care to find out more about.

A Summoning Room~
Baragar and Alara use (or used) this room for practicing their gate spells,
but when one spell summoned a denizen of the lower planes that they couldn't
control, they hastily sealed it in this room. And now you have released it.
Way to go.

A Junction~
You are at a rather busy junction in the dungeons. To the north runs a dark
passage, while to the south lies a door. To the west lies the source of
the noises you heard earlier. it is obvious that a team of workers is
excavating down here. Perhaps Baraga wishes to unearth the treasures
rumored to lie in the ancient caverns beneath his keep...?

Here there is a crude elevator which you can use to lower yourself into
the lower caverns, wherein the excavation is occuring. But also down there
lies the entryway to the ancient caverns, where no one dares travel.

A Lab~
This room was once used as a lab, but Baragar grew bored with alchemy,
and abandoned it. Eventually a Grell from the lower caverns made its way
up here, and created a nest in this lab. Baragar was fascinated by the
bizarre creature, and sealed it within, intending one day to study it. He
occasionally feeds it the odd slave or guard.

The Roof of the Inner Keep~
You are standing on the roof, atop the highest point of the whole keep.
The lands of Past Anon lay spread out before you, and from this windswept
position you can see for miles. You hear the cry of some bird, and look
above to see several vultures slowly winging their way toward the desolate
deserts to the south. In those deserts there is rumored to be a fantastic
place filled with wondrous treasures.

Workers rush back and forth, busily carting bags of excavated stone to and

ignore such wealth.
