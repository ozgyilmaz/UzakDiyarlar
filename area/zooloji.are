You are standing right inside the entrance to the museum.  Wow, this is
going to be such fun!  You quickly evade your MudSchool teacher and go off
on your own.  To the north you see the entrance to the mud museum, while
upstairs you see a souviniere shop.  To the south is the Hall of the Beefed
up Tinsy Animals, while to the west is the Wide World of Chordates.  Finally
to the east you see the special marine section of the museum.

This is the Hall of Chordates.  All around you are really boring
examples of what a chordate is.  A beastly fido is a chordate, as is the
mayor of Midgaard.  This is boring, you think.

Wow, you're about as interested in this as you are about the stuff that
grows in between your toes.  Oh, that's in another hall in this museum.
Silly you.  You contemplate pulling a fire alarm to make this trip a
little more interesting.  The hall of chordates continues to the south.

Things float around you as if you were in water.  Plankton, seaweed,
garbage, oil coated ducks; it's so realistic you think!  Only problem is,
you don't have an ounce of interest.  You spot the shark tank to the east
and the hall continues to the south.
