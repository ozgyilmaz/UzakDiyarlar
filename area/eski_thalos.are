This is a magnificent street, immaculate all over.  The streets are filled
with people rushing from building to building and a balmy zephyr blows by you.
The whole city is teeming with activity.  On one side is a beautiful house
while on the other is the entrance to a large mansion.  Sounds of people hard
at work echo within the mansion.  Near the center of town you see a large
domed building, magnificent and immense.

The footprints make a path that looks rather bewildered and is not the kind
of path to lead to anywhere significant or important but it seems to have
made up its mind to enter the hills far away north.  A little distance
further, you lose the trail and decide not to get lost.

Vampire's labrotory~
This is the Magical Experiments Laboratory of Vampire.  Dark smoke-stained
stones arch over numerous huge oaken tables, most of these cluttered with
strange-looking  flasks.  The floor is covered with half-erased pentagrams
and even weirder symbols, and a blackboard in a dark corner has only been
partially cleaned, some painful-looking letters faintly visible.  A well in
the middle of the floor leads down into darkness.  Vile smells waft from the
depths.
