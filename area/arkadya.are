The change of nature does not cause the change of court nor does the
change of court cause the change in nature.  With the fae such things as
cause are irrelevent, they simply are.  It is one of the things that make
the fae so able to facinate mortals.
~
E
sayfa1~
The Seelie and Unseelie houses are the cornerstone of the fae nature.
The Seelie is all that is chivalrous, good, fair, beautiful, light and
graceful while the Unseelie is the counterpart of each of these
qualities.  Just as the fae court switches alliances with each season so
do individual fae.  While being immortal in nature, the fae are not
unchanging.  The fae switch from one court to another at times within
their existence.  The change is one of internal alliance and a once
honest and loving Seelie fae can become a dishonest and distrusting one
by changing courts.

The Fool seems to also ignore the house differences.  He seems to owe no
particular alliegence to either court and seems to retain full use of his
seemingly addled faculties throughout the year despite the seasonal
variences that so affect his kind.

sayfa1~
Puck is perhaps the single most powerful of all the fae.  Even Gwyn ap
Nudd and Oberon pay this wanderer heed.  While usually he is nothing more
than a trickster it seems that he is the only fae that has not gone a
change of roles since the last cycle of fae existence. Why the Fool is
exempt from these yearly changes is a mystery that only he may know and
as is his nature he isn't telling.

You are standing on the top of the hill.  The structure you thought
you saw from the bottom must have just been something created by a
combination of the light, the mist and your imagination because there is
not castle here.  There is however a small standing stone with some worn
engravings on it.  The only exit is down.

A tapestry on the east wall depicts two young figures, one boy and one
girl.  For a moment you long for the lost innocence of that youth and you
yearn to enter the tapestry, but then you pull yourself away from it's
strange lure.  The hall continues north and south.

Yaz Salonu~
This hall is all green leaves and grass of a summer day.  Golden
raidience shines down from the open roof above and birds chirp.  From
somewhere you hear a brook babbling.  The eastern wall is dominated by a
tapestry that shows two lovers in the prime of their life, and passions,
in a summer field.  You sense that if you entered the now shimmering
tapestry you too would be forever young and beautiful, unchanging and
untouchable.  The tapestry dims and you hear laughter in the distance.
The hall continues to the north and south.

Sonbahar Salonu~
The smell of fallen leaves and aproaching rain drifts sweetly through
your senses.  Around you you see all the colors of autumn, bright reds,
orange, yellows, browns and pale green.  Soft rain drizzles in from the
clouded grey sky above this chamber. There is a soft quiet sense to this room,
and when you look at the tapestry on the west wall depicting a middle
aged couple resting quietly in each others arms you long for quiet
companionship and find yourself reaching toward the tapestry.  You are
shaken out of the trance by a raven's croak and you stand for a moment
confused.  The hall continues to the north and south.

Kış Salonu~
This hall is carpeted in deep, light snow that seems to be falling
in from the ceiling.  Small ice statues can be seen in the distance and
the treelike branches above are covered to near breaking with ice.  A cold
wind blows with a shrill sound through the hall.  Totaly unmoved by the
wind is a bright white tapestry on the west wall that shows an old couple
whose faces show infinite wisdom and complacency.  You are entranced by
the wisdom that the old couple wears like a mantle and you suddenly
desire to seek it out by joining them in the tapestry. Then you hear a
high pitched cackling and you shiver with the cold.  The Hall continues
to the north and south.
